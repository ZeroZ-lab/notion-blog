Genesis is a comprehensive physics simulation platform designed for general purpose _Robotics_, _Embodied AI_, & _Physical AI_ applications. It is simultaneously multiple things:

- A **universal physics engine** re-built from the ground up, capable of simulating a wide range of materials and physical phenomena.
- A **lightweight**, **ultra-fast**, **pythonic**, and **user-friendly** robotics simulation platform.
- A powerful and fast **photo-realistic rendering** system.
- A **generative data engine** that transforms user-prompted natural language description into various modalities of data.

Powered by a universal physics engine re-designed and re-built from the ground up, Genesis integrates various physics solvers and their coupling into a unified framework. This core physics engine is further enhanced by a generative agent framework that operates at an upper level, aiming towards fully automated data generation for robotics and beyond. Our generative framework aims to automate generating data including the following modalities:

- Physically-accurate & spatially consistent videos
- Camera motion & parameters
- Human and animal character motion
- Robotic manipulation & locomotion policy, deployable to real-world
- Fully interactive 3D scene
- Open-world articulated object generation
- Speech audio, facial animation & emotion

Currently, we are open-sourcing the underlying physics engine and the simulation platform. Access to the generative framework will be rolled out gradually in the near future.


This webpage serves as a gallery showcasing different capabilities of the Genesis platform. Please refer to our [documentation site ](https://genesis-world.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to for detailed installation steps, tutorials and API references.


## Optimized Performance


Genesis is a highly-optimized physics engine that leverages GPU-accelerated parallel computation, with features like optimized collision checking, auto-hibernation, contact island, etc. Genesis delivers an unprecedented simulation speed in various scenes.


When simulating a manipulation scene (with a single plane and a Franka arm), Genesis runs at 43 millision FPS, which is 430,000 times faster than in real time.


In large-scale simulation, Genesis utilizied auto-hibernation to speed up simulation of entities that are in converged and static states. (This feature is under testing and will be release in version 0.1.1).

## Generating 4D dynamical & physical world


Genesis's physics engine is empowered by a VLM-based generated agent that uses the APIs provided by the simulation infrastructure as tools to create 4D dynamic worlds, which can then be used as a foundational data source for extracting various modalities of data. Together with modules for generating camera and object motion, we are able to generate physically-accurate and view-consistent videos and other modalities of data.

## Character Motion Generation


[wukong.mp4](https://genesis-embodied-ai.github.io/videos/wukong.mp4)


"_A miniature Wukong holding a stick in his hand sprints across a table surface for 3 seconds, then jumps into the air, and swings his right arm downward during landing. The camera begins with a close-up of his face, then steadily follows the character while gradually zooming out. When the monkey leaps into the air, at the highest point of the jump, the motion pauses for a few seconds. The camera circles around the character for 360 degrees, and slowly ascends, before the action resumes._"

## Robotic Policy Generation


Genesis aims to use generative robotic agent and physics engine to automatically generate robotic policies and demonstration data for various skills under different scenarios. For the high-level motivation and more details behind the module, see [RoboGen](https://robogen-ai.github.io/) and our upcoming paper.
