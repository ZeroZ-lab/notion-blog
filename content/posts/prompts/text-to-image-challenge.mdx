Extreme photorealistic view of the scene as seen through a slightly wet, curved single AR lens of a pair of smart glasses held in front of the camera, on a rainy evening during late golden hour transitioning into blue hour. The low sun is still just above the horizon on the right.

In the deep, humid sky on the left, opposite the sun, a faint but physically plausible rainbow arc is visible after the passing rain shower.

The single round AR lens occupies the right side of the image. Through this transparent AR lens, we see only the right half of a tall, transparent nine-storey glass tower on stilts by a calm riverside. The left half of the tower extends outside the lens area into the rest of the frame, so the vertical lines of the façade and floors must align correctly across the lens boundary, appearing slightly bent inside the lens due to mild barrel distortion and straight outside it.

Inside the AR lens:
– Mild barrel distortion and realistic depth-of-field: the middle floors of the glass tower are in perfect sharp focus, while the foreground and far background are slightly blurred.
– The calm river surface, as seen through the lens, reflects the right half of the glass tower, the sky and the faint rainbow with small ripples causing gentle distortion; near the shore, underwater rocks and a few fish are visible.
– Warm indoor lights illuminate the interiors on each visible floor, contrasting with the cool blue ambient light from outside.

Overlaid on top of the real scene inside the lens is a subtle AR interface, with clean, semi-transparent white typography and fine UI lines that follow the perspective of the tower. Each visible floor has a floating AR label and a short text description anchored to the right half of that floor, with a thin connector line pointing to the interior:

1. Ground floor:
   – AR label near the right side of the ground floor, reading: “1F · Family Kitchen”
   – Smaller AR subtitle below: “Cooking dinner · Steam and warm light”
   – The right half of a family cooking in a modern kitchen is visible behind the HUD text, with steam rising from pots and subtle reflections on glass and metal surfaces, and part of a dining table extending beyond the lens boundary.

2. Second floor:
   – AR label: “2F · Artist Studio”
   – Subtitle: “Painter at work · Large canvas by the window”
   – The right half of an artist’s studio is visible, with a painter working at a large canvas near the window and paint tools scattered on the floor.
   – A large wall mirror inside the room reflects both part of the interior and a slice of the riverside outside the window, with correctly reversed geometry and lighting.

3. Third floor:
   – AR label: “3F · Design Office”
   – Subtitle: “Team discussion · UI review in progress”
   – The right half of an office shows two people discussing at a desk with glowing laptop screens.
   – On this floor, a large monitor shows a clearly readable interface with a “Design Review 18:30” title and a few legible UI elements and short text lines.

4. Fourth floor:
   – AR label: “4F · Reading Room”
   – Subtitle: “Quiet notes · Bookshelves and desk lamp”
   – The right half of a quiet reading room is visible, with bookshelves along the wall and a person sitting at a desk taking notes, lit by a warm desk lamp.

5. Fifth floor:
   – AR label: “5F · Mini Gym”
   – Subtitle: “Treadmill run · Evening workout”
   – The right half of a small gym is visible, with someone running on a treadmill near the window and another person stretching, their reflections partially visible in a side window or polished surface.

6. Sixth floor:
   – AR label: “6F · Child’s Room”
   – Subtitle: “Story time · Toys on the floor”
   – The right half of a child’s room is visible, with toys scattered on the floor and a parent sitting and reading a book to the child under soft, warm lighting.

7. Seventh floor:
   – AR label: “7F · Workshop Lab”
   – Subtitle: “Careful inspection · Tools neatly arranged”
   – The right half of a lab or workshop is visible, with tools neatly arranged on shelves and a person examining a small object under a focused desk lamp.

8. Eighth floor:
   – AR label: “8F · Lounge”
   – Subtitle: “Friends talking · Warm ambient lights”
   – The right half of a cozy lounge is visible, where friends are talking on a sofa under warm ambient lighting, with part of a coffee table and decorative objects visible.

9. Ninth floor rooftop:
   – AR label: “9F · Rooftop Garden”
   – Subtitle: “Tea under string lights · Evening sky”
   – The right half of a rooftop garden is visible, with two friends drinking tea under warm string lights and soft lanterns, surrounded by plants and a partial glass roof structure, with the evening sky visible above.

All AR labels and subtitles are crisp and clearly readable, slightly glowing but semi-transparent so that the real interiors remain visible behind them. Thin UI connector lines from each label point precisely toward the corresponding half-floor interior, following the perspective lines of the tower façade.

Across all these half-scenes, the glass façade of the tower within the lens shows accurate reflections of the sky, the faint rainbow and some distant city lights, while still clearly revealing the interior scenes and the AR overlays without visual conflict.

On the single AR lens:
– Several sharp raindrops cling to the lens surface, each acting as a tiny lens, slightly magnifying and inverting small fragments of the half-tower and lights behind them.
– Subtle chromatic aberration (red/cyan fringes) appears along high-contrast edges near the border of the lens.
– Very soft reflections of the sky, the faint rainbow and distant city lights are visible on the curved lens surface, blending naturally with both the transmitted real image and the overlaid AR text and UI.

Outside the lens:
– The left half of the same nine-storey glass tower continues seamlessly in the open air, without barrel distortion and without AR overlays, but slightly out of focus and a bit less saturated, preserving the alignment of all floors and façade lines.
– The calm river continues, reflecting the full tower and the rainbow with reflection geometry physically consistent with the parts of the tower visible inside and outside the lens.
– The frame of the smart glasses and the hand holding them are partially visible on the right, with correct perspective, shading and specular highlights under the mixed warm and cool lighting.
– The observer’s vague silhouette is also visible as a reflection on the glass façade of the tower and on the river surface, in a position consistent with the camera and lens location.

Overall composition is clean and cinematic, with the single AR lens forming a natural frame on the right side of the image. High dynamic range, physically plausible lighting and multiple consistent reflections, ultra-sharp where in focus and naturally blurred elsewhere, no clutter, and the AR labels integrate seamlessly with the physical scene.
